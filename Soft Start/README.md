# What is this?

An interface board for a Raspberry Pi (or other SBC) to properly function with an ATX power supply.


Hooked up to an appropriate button, a single press will turn on the power supply, and then another single press will send a signal to the computer (and then software can safely turn off the computer and then power supply).
