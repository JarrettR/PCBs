# What is this?

A super simple RGB LED strip.

Contains 5 discrete WS2812B RGB LEDs (and one 100nF 0603 cap per LED).


These are 5 cm long strips, designed to be soldered directly to the ends of each other.


They can be made with 0.6mm FR4, so they're slightly springy, and can be bent into curves or other interesting things. The mount holes between each LED help the PCB bend at the right place, and provide convenient points to hold everything together with steel cable or similar.
