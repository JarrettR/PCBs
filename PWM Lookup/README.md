# What is this?
The beginning of a collection of Raspberry Pi power-related modules.

ATX is a circuit that allows a single button to turn on and latch a standard ATX computer power supply.
Another press of the button will signal the Pi the user's intent to shut down, and it will gracefully do so and then shut down the power supply.

Obviously, the Raspberry Pi can be used for its main function while on, this doesn't take up the entire codebase or anything.
