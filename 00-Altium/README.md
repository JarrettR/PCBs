# What is this?

A selection of Altium libraries that I have found useful.

Additionally, included is my custom Altium library. Anybody serious about schematic capture software needs their own. Some of these are done from scratch, some modified from standard library parts.

Don't trust these!

Don't trust any library that is not your own, in fact!

You will get burned! Only trust your own libraries.
