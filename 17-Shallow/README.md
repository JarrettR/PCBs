## Shallow

A nautilus-themed PCB create in [PCBmodE](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode)

### The hook

PCBmodE is not your standard ECAD package. It's a collection of JSON files that get converted into SVG or gerber files.

There are some limited tools to convert SVG files back into JSON, too. Consider it like forward- and back-annotation.

The end takeaway is that these circuits are _drawn_, not engineered.
