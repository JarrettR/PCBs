# What is this?

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has product called the Compute Module. It's a full RaspPi, but in the SODIMM2 form factor, originally for laptop RAM. This is a wiring harness for Altium to make generating new boards for it really really easy.


Naturally, by the time I finished this portion of the work, I had no idea what to do with it. So, someday, I will make a Compute Module project, but not today.
