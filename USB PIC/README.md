# What is this?

Nothing, yet!

The orignal goal of this was to have a tiny flashdrive form-factor USB toy/dev board. That got spun out into [this](https://github.com/JarrettR/USBvil) repo and completed.

# What next?

It would be nice to have a more powerful microcontroller on board, some more pins out, and generally a better experimentation platform with less of a focus on minimising cost.

I'll create my own USB male board contact pattern, because it's fun. This folder is mostly for storing reference photos, currently.

Note to self: hard gold plating is required for finger contacts.
